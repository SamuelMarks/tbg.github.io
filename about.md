title: About
---

An excellent problem solver with a strong background in Computer Sciences and Mathematics, along with a penchant for tackling complex situations.
I like distributed systems, Open Source, statically typed languages, memory
safe languages ([Rust](https://rust-lang.org) being the one I've dabbled with), and the Oxford comma.

In my day job, I'm (morally, thanks to a visa waiting period) first employee at [Cockroach Labs](https://cockroachlabs.com), a company building a scalable, survivable, strongly consistent, SQL database named [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach).
