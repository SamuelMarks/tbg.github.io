An excellent problem solver with a strong background in Computer Sciences and Mathematics, along with a penchant for tackling complex situations.

I freelance full-time and am currently based in Cologne, Germany.

Thinking laterally and writing clearly, I build transparent, testable and maintainable systems.
Favorites include distributed systems, DevOps and the dive into the unknown.

JS, Go, Python, Ruby, JAVA, C++ and a few others spoken. Experienced and regular user of [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), [Docker](http://docker.io) as well as a wide variety of databases. Avid (10+ years) user of Linux, active [OpenSource contributor](https://github.com/tschottdorf/).

Currently contributing to [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/), a distributed, transactional, replicated database.
