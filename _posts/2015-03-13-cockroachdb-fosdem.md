At this year's editiion of [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org), I gave a presentation
on [Cockroach](http://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach). In the talk, I went
into more technical detail about how Cockroach implements fast, lock-free
transactions. It was a pleasant experience with lots of interesting questions
from the audience both during and after the talk.

If you're curious, check out
[CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) and watch the talk
below.
